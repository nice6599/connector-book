# Definition

> An electrical connector, is an electro-mechanical device used to join electrical terminations and create an electrical circuit. Electrical connectors consist of plugs (male-ended) and jacks (female-ended).
The connection may be temporary, as for portable equipment, require a tool for assembly and removal, or serve as a permanent electrical joint between two wires or devices.[1] An adapter can be used to effectively bring together dissimilar connectors.

# Catagories

> At first thought i thought i could do a chapter on each broad use of connectors but now I realize that having an index or table of conetents makes more sense than using chapters to differentiate cable types. 

they will be divided later as i see fit
